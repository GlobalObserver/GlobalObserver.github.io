      <p>To be eligible, workers must have at least a U.S. bachelor‚Äôs degree, among other things. The visa allows holders to legally work in the United States for three years, with the possibility of extensions.</p>
      <p>In 2019 alone, there were 190,098 petitions for the H-1B, only a fraction of those applicants were granted the highly coveted visa.</p>
      <p>If you are an international student, you might be curious or have researched extensively about ways find employers who are willing to sponsor, how to file for and how you can qualify for the visa. Whatever stage you might be in the preparation, you can always test your knowledge with this simple quiz about H-1B visa. Are you ready?</p>

        <p id="ans1d" class="choice">U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE)</p>
        <p class="answer" id="aside1" hidden>According to its website, USCIS is the government agency that oversees lawful immigration to the United States.</p>

      <h4 class="questionno">2 of 10</h4>
      <h3 id="q2" class="question">Where are most foreign workers on H-1B visas from?</h3>

        <div id="aside4" hidden>
          <p class="answer">The President appears to have mixed feelings towards granting authorizations for skilled foreign workers to the U.S. In 2017, he issued the Buy American, Hire American executive order suggesting reforms to "ensure that H-1B visas are awarded to the most-skilled or highest-paid petition beneficiaries.‚Äù The order worried many students and workers planning to obtain the popular visa to work in the U.S. However, in a tweet in 2019, he assured H1-B holders in the United States, promising changes that will bring "simplicity and certainty to your stay, including a potential path to citizenship.‚Äù</p>
