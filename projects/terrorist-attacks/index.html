              <p class="subhead">The conversation about US terrorism centers mostly on attacks by foreign groups specifically Al-Qaeda but data shows that between 2011 and 2019, the US saw a surge in terrorism tied to domestic white supremacy.

            <p class="content">

                The United States has a long history of confronting serious challenges from terrorists worldwide. Before I came to the U.S. to pursue a Master's degree, the conversation about terrorist attacks with my friends mostly centered around the 9/11 attacks that took more than 3,000 lives. It was not until reading <a href="https://www.politifact.com/article/2019/dec/05/terrorism-united-states-key-facts-patterns-and-tre/">this article</a> that I realized the US has been dealing with a large number of domestic terrorist attacks, too. </br></br>
                I dug deeper into the recent history of terrorism and its patterns by cleaning and visualizing data from The Global Terrorism <a href="https://www.start.umd.edu/gtd">Database</a> (GTD), which includes information on terrorist attacks around the world from 1970 through 2019.</br></br>
                The GTD classified an incident as a terrorist attack if it intentionally used violence or threat of violence in the pursuit of political, economic, religious or social goals. It also holds that only sub-national groups, instead of states, can commit acts of terrorism. Types of terrorist attacks include bombings, mass shootings, hijackings, etc. </br></br>

            <div class="right-col">

            </div>
             <aside class="content intro">
                <p id="intro-texts">
                    I used a radial chart where the background grids represent the months and years and each colored circle indicates a terrorist attack. The size of the circle is proportional to the number of deaths in the attack. </br>
                </p>
                <p id="zero-death">
                    Attacks with zero deaths are also presented in the chart. Of the 938 terrorist attacks documented by the dataset, 795 incidents had no casualties. </br>
                </p>
                <p id="with-deaths">
                    The other 136 attacks killed more than 3,600 people.</br>
                </p>
                <p id="with-multicolors">
                    Each circle is color based on the type of attack including islamic extremists, right-wing extremists, incel extremists, animal-rights-related and others</br>
                </p>
                <p id="nine-eleven">
                    Here’s the 9/11 attack initiated by the Islamic terrorist group, Al-Qaeda.  
                </p>
                <p id="alqaeda">
                    There was a series of terrorist attacks by the same group on that day, which injured more than 25,000 people and killed more than 3,000 people including around 300 firefighters and emergency responders.</br>
                </p>

                <p id="alqaeda-and-jihadi-inspired">
                    Since then, the conversation on terrorism has focused mainly on Islamic extremist groups.</br></br>  
                </p>
                <p id="right-inspired">

                    But what's also worth noticing is that between 2002 and 2019, attacks initiated by domestic far-right extremists killed 103 people in the United States.</br>

                </p>


                <p id="jihadi-and-right-wing">
                    That's almost exactly the same number of people killed by "Jihadi-inspired" terror attacks, which claimed 110 lives.</br>
                </p>

                <p id="right-wing">
                    The types of right-wing extremist groups in this visualization include anti-government, anti-abortion, white supremacist, anti-Semitics, anti-LGBT and Neo-Nazi.</br>
                </p>


                <p id="white">
                    
                    Many white extremist killers were inspired by earlier attacks. </br></br>
                    <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2019/04/03/world/white-extremist-terrorism-christchurch.html">An analysis</a> done by The New York Times indicated that "… at least a third of white extremist killers since 2011 were inspired by others who perpetrated similar attacks …"</br>

                </p>

                <p id="white-sec">
                    Many of these attacks targeted places of worship. The deadliest attacks by white extremist groups include a shooting at a Sikh temple in Wisconsin in 2012 and a shooting at a Black church in South Carolina in 2015.</br>

                </p>

                <p id="incel">
                    There are other domestic extremist groups with different claims as well.</br></br>

                    Some radical Incel extremists seek violence against women to do justice to men having sexual failures. </br>
                </p>

                <p id="animal-rights">
                    Groups with environmental-related claims such as the Animal Liberation Front and Earth Liberation Front have emerged in the past 10 years and were labeled as serious terrorist threats by the FBI. </br>
