        <section class="text">
          <p>The number of approved H-1B visas saw a dip in 2017 despite the high number of petitions that same year. The USCIS has not yet publicly released numbers for 2018 and 2019. The dramatic decrease comes in the wake of President Trump's <a href="https://www.uscis.gov/legal-resources/buy-american-hire-american-putting-american-workers-first">Buy American, Hire American</a> executive order aiming to enable higher wages and employment rates for U.S. workers by enforcing and administering stricter immigration laws, the order specifically directs the Department of Homeland Security to "ensure H-1B visas are awarded to the most-skilled or highest-paid beneficiaries."</p>

According to the agency, as a result of this rule, workers with a U.S. master’s or higher degree will have a greater chance of selection in the H-1B lottery.</p>
